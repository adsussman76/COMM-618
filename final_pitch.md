## The Question 
Over the last few years, some of the most talked about television shows were made outside the United States. Programs like *Squid Game* were as much a part of the water cooler conversation as American shows, like *House of the Dragon.* Gone are the days of Americans being turned off by subtitles. 

Some articles put the start of this rise in popularity at the beginning of the pandemic, when audiences were desperate for series to stream and American production was on hiatus. But it looks like the trend may have started even earlier, thanks to cross-cultural sharing via social media. 

So, when did this trend really begin? How much of Americans’ television diet is made up of foreign television shows and how has that percentage grown over the past couple of decades? What role do streaming services play in this growth? What role does social media play?  

## The Data 
I will be looking for data that shows how much foreign television is consumed in the United States for as many years as I can find it (hopefully going back long enough to show growth). I’ll also want to know which countries’ content is the most popular. 

## The Sources 
In addition to the data, I’d like to talk to people knowledgeable about media trends, like media professors. I’d also like to talk to someone who works at a streaming service, like Netflix, if possible, about how they decide what shows to put on their platform and why they think they’ve had success with shows from other countries.
