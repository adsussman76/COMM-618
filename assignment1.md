# Class Survey Data #
Of the software and programs the members of the Data-Driven Journalism class were surveyed about, they were most familiar with using spreadsheets. This is not too surprising as spreadsheet programs, like Excel, are fairly common in school and workplace settings. Members of the class were least familiar with SQL; programming and scripting languages; and R and python. On average, respondents were 3.12 times more familiar with spreadsheets than they were with these other programs.

Looking at just the students from the the two journalism programs, Journalism and Public Affairs (JUPA) and Journalism and Digital Storytelling (JRDS), the JUPA students have more familiarity in every topic except programming and scripting language. The journalism program students have no experience with versions control systems, SQL, and R/python. From this, I would guess that the journalism students have a lot to learn and will, hopefully, find this class very instructive.

One of the most surprising findings of the survey was the number of people who listed a romantic comedy as their favorite movie. Four out of the eight survey respondents chose a rom-com as their favorite movie. Given that most of the highest-grossing movies in the past decade have been superhero and other franchise movies, it was interesting to see romantic comedies having this much traction. Only one of the survey respondents chose a movie that is part of a franchise: *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back*.
