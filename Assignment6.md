[Chart: Percentage of current cigarette and e-cigarette users in the U.S.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRWTKQSOjEHSpWSjN_SRrU2qVrIdf9730PnnpJshX9vOz-_RTNJbzXb2XOvvlhnAHlaZm4fzzw0vD2h/pubchart?oid=134067247&amp;format=interactive)

The chart above shows the percentages of adults, ages 18 and up, and youths in grades six through 12 who have used cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the last 30 days.  

The adult data comes from CDC’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which gathers information from around 30,000 adults through household interviews each year. During the first half of 2020, the NHIS was collected via telephone instead of in person due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The youth data is from the CDC’s National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), which collects responses from about 30,000 middle and high schoolers through a self-administered survey. Before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the survey was administered at school. Since 2020, the survey can be filled out at home or at school. The CDC has stated that the 2020 and 2021 NYTS results cannot be compared with previous years due to this change. 

In the eight years illustrated on the chart, the percentage of adults and youths who smoke cigarettes has fallen slightly. This is a continuation of a decades-long decline in cigarette consumption, [documented here by the Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK294310/figure/ch2.f1/). 

Adult e-cigarette use remained relatively stable between 2014 and 2021, with only around three percent consistently using vapes. Youth e-cigarette use, however, was two to five times more than their adult counterparts, depending on the year. Between 2014 and 2019, the number of adolescents who used e-cigarettes doubled. In 2019, 1 in 5 middle and high schoolers surveyed reported vaping in the last 30 days.  

[An article from the journal *Missouri Medicine*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023954/) attributes the high number of youth e-cigarette users to advertising directed directly at adolescents, citing one study that found 78% of middle and high school students had been exposed to at least one e-cigarette advertisement between 2014 and 2016. The article also mentions vape pod flavors, like gummi bear and frosted sugar cookie, that are designed to appeal to younger users.
