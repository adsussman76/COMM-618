# Trump campaign spends hundreds of thousands at Trump properties

Donald Trump’s presidential campaign spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the president’s businesses during the 2020 primary election campaign. According to data pulled from Federal Election Committee records, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. spent more than $825,000 on Trump's companies through 92 disbursements.

Expenditures included more than $160,000 on legal consulting from the Trump Corporation, $550,000 for renting space at three different Trump properties, and $42,000 in lodging at Trump hotels. 

The largest disbursement was an almost $159,000 payment to Trump Tower Commercial LLC made for rent in February 2017. This came one month after a $75,000 payment also to Trump Tower Commercial LLC. The FEC paperwork does not go into further detail about what the space was rented for.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said the campaign’s payments are all legal under FEC law.

Richard Briffault, an expert on campaign finance law and Columbia Law School professor, agrees that these payments likely do not violate the law. There are no laws preventing payments to the candidate’s properties as long as the business doesn’t overcharge the campaign.

In addition to Trump’s campaign, FEC filings show Trump-supporting political action committees and the Republican National Committee also had large expenditure’s at the president’s businesses. Together, the RNC and PACs spent more than $630,000 in 51 separate payments during the 2016, 2018 and 2020 election cycles. Descriptions for these expenses include venue rental and catering, travel expenses, and food/beverage.

The biggest contribution to that number came from the RNC, which spent more than half a million dollars at Trump properties. This included two "venue rental and catering” expenses at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. and Trump National Doral Miami each amounting to more than $100,000.

RNC Spokesperson Liz Harrington said Trump hotels are competitively priced and can accommodate the president’s security needs.

Methods: Text in [brackets] refers to a tab on in the Sheets document. I went a little overboard with the tabs!

First, I imported the .csv into Google Sheets [trump_spending] and then sorted the data by committee name [sort]. From there, I separated out entries for “DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC.” into a separate sheet [campaign] and further filtered those data to just include expenses for the 2020 campaign [campaign 2020]. I conformed some of the entries that weren’t standardized (recipient name and disbursement description) [campaign 2020 sort] and created pivot tables to see which Trump companies received money from the Trump campaign, how much money they received, and what the expenditure was categorized as [Pivot Table 1]. I also created a pivot table to see how much money was spent on each category, like rent, lodging, etc. [Pivot Table 2]

I went through the same process with sorting out Trump PAC and RNC expenditures at Trump properties [pacs & rnc] and created a pivot table to see how much money each committee spent and which businesses received that money [Pivot Table 3].
