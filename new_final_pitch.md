## The Question 
Is vaping the new cigarettes? Or, more specifically, has vaping become more popular than cigarettes? And how does it compare to historic cigarette usage (like at the U.S. population’s smoking peak in the 1960s)? We hear a lot about the dangers of vaping in the news, especially among younger people. I’d like to look into how big of a problem vaping really is, both quantitatively and relative to smoking historically. I’d also talk to experts about what has caused the increase in vaping, decrease in smoking, and the potential dangers of both.
